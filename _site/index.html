<h1>Technologies</h1>
<h4>Deep Learning</h4>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms, which is used in the design of artificially intelligent robots, making it the basis for most features that make a machine ‘intelligent’.

Deep learning models are loosely related to information processing and communication patterns in a biological nervous system, such as neural coding that attempts to define a relationship between various stimuli and associated neuronal responses in the brain.

Some technologies that utilize deep learning are:</p>
<ul>

<li>computer vision</li>
<li>speech recognition</li>
<li>natural language processing</li>
<li>machine translation</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;">
In deep learning, each level learns to transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation. For instance, in an image recognition application, the raw input may be a matrix of pixels; the first representational layer may abstract the pixels and encode edges; the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges; the third layer may encode a nose and eyes; and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face. Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level on its own.

<dl id="faqs">
  
 
  <dt>Computer Vision</dt>
  <dd><p style="text-align:left;">Computer vision deals with how computers can be made for gaining high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do.<br>

Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.
Some functions of computer vision are, but not limited to;</p>
<ul>
<li>Detecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting</li>
<li>Organizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
 
  <dt>Speech Recognition</dt>
  <dd><p style="text-align:left;">Speech recognition is a sub-field of computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers. It is also known as "automatic speech recognition" (ASR), "computer speech recognition", or just "speech to text" (STT). It incorporates knowledge and research in the linguistics, computer science, and electrical engineering fields.

Some speech recognition systems require "training" (also called "enrollment") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system. The system analyzes the person's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person's speech, resulting in increased accuracy. Systems that do not use training are called "speaker independent" systems. Systems that use training are called "speaker dependent".

From the technology perspective, speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations. Most recently, the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data. The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field, but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems. </p>
</dd>
<dt>Natural Language Processing</dt>
  <dd><p style="text-align:left;">Natural-language processing (NLP) is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to fruitfully process large amounts of natural language data.

Challenges in natural-language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Machine Translation</dt>
  <dd><p style="text-align:left;">Machine translation, sometimes referred to by the abbreviation MT (not to be confused with computer-aided translation, machine-aided human translation (MAHT) or interactive translation) is a sub-field of computational linguistics that investigates the use of software to translate text or speech from one language to another.

On a basic level, MT performs simple substitution of words in one language for words in another, but that alone usually cannot produce a good translation of a text because recognition of whole phrases and their closest counterparts in the target language is needed. Solving this problem with corpus statistical, and neural techniques is a rapidly growing field that is leading to better translations, handling differences in linguistic typology, translation of idioms, and the isolation of anomalies.</p>

<h1>Future Uses</h1>
<dl id="faqs">
  <dt>Education</dt>
  <dd><p style="text-align:left;">Artificial Intelligence will no doubt play a significant role in education in the future, saving time for teachers as well as students, making learning a far more efficient process. One of the most prominent developments in educational AI is automated essay grading, which has drawn a lot of interest in regards to its low cost, accountability, standards, and technology. Rising education costs have led to pressure to hold the educational system accountable for results by imposing standards. The advance of information technology promises to measure educational achievement at reduced cost.

Another remarkable advantage that Artificial Intelligence will bring into education is the AI-powered, data-driven understanding of individual students’ learning needs. As teachers can’t always notice when students have trouble following the lesson, or their individual weaknesses, AI will closely observe students to help them learn with optimal efficiency. AI is also naturally objective, and thus can help with grading students more fairly. This way, students can show their full potential and drastic gaps between students can be overcome.</p>
</dd>
 
  <dt>Business</dt>
  <dd><p style="text-align:left;">It is undeniable that businesses currently benefit considerably from AI, in both sales as well as in getting tasks done more efficiently. As a result, there’s a growing trend towards the automation of routine work. Artificial intelligence is quickly automating routine processes, the same way industrial era machines automated physical labor. Not only are these technologies extremely capable, they also don’t require coffee, lunch or smoke breaks.<br>


Every business manager, entrepreneur, and business decision maker should look into the benefits that artificial intelligence can offer them in their commercial endeavors. As AI technologies are expected to develop at an increasing pace, AI will gain even importance in the future, becoming a prominent point of commercial competition.</p>
</dd>
 
  <dt>Beyond</dt>
  <dd><h2>Healthcare</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">

Artificial intelligence is steadily gaining importance in the medical field. Artificial intelligence in healthcare is used in creation of algorithms and software to approximate human cognition in the analysis of complex medical data. The primary aim of health-related AI applications is to analyze relationships between prevention or treatment techniques and patient outcomes. AI programs have been developed and applied to practices such as diagnosis processes, treatment protocol development, drug development, personalized medicine,and patient monitoring and care. 
</p>

<h2>Finance and Trading</h2>

<p style="text-align:left;">AI has gained significance in finance because of its efficiency. Such a technology algorithmic trading involves the use of complex AI systems to make trading decisions at speeds several orders of magnitudes greater than any human is capable of, often making millions of trades in a day without any human intervention. Automated trading systems are typically used by large institutional investors to optimize their gains.</p>

<h2>Customer Service</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">
Artificial intelligence is implemented in automated online assistants that can be seen as avatars on web pages. It can avail for enterprises to reduce their operation and training cost. A major underlying technology to such systems is natural language processing. In the future AI-powered customer service will gain even more importance, helping companies get in touch with customers more efficiently.</p>

</dd>

<h1>Safety Concerns</h1>
<p style="text-align:left;">Artificial intelligence is designed so that it can learn from interactions with its surroundings and alter its behavior accordingly, which could provide incredible benefits to humanity. Naturally, an expansion of the AI’s knowledge and experiences raises concerns about how well the AI will continue to serve its purpose. In this case the question that needs to be asked is, how can we ensure safety for a technology that is designed to learn how to modify its own behavior?


By design, the AI is created with traditional security techniques that prevents malicious attackers from causing the AI to take an undesirable action as well as cancelling out the possibility that the AI might choose an undesirable action independently. Furthermore, these safety principles are implemented into the core of the AI by building in an intrinsic set of values that ensure the AI will prioritize human safety above everything and serve humans to the best of its ability.

</p>
<h1>Investing in Robotics</h1>
<p style="text-align:left;margin-bottom:50px;">The robotics industry expands rapidly, in fact the investments in robotics are expected to exceed $180 billion by 2020. As the market grows, prices will go down, making robotics services available to the general public. Thus it is sensible to get involved with the industry and start investing early on.</p>
