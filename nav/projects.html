<h2>Technology Student Association</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">Our team has participated in the competitions organized by the Technology Student Association since 2012. Our chapter was founded by our alum Doğa Doğan, who won our first trophy in the Webmaster event in 2013.

<h2>MINT-Camps</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">MINT-EC, or Verein mathematisch-naturwissenschaftlicher Excellence-Center an Schulen, is a German nonprofit organization founded by the Confederation of German Employers' Association. It aims to inspire and encourage students in STEM subjects (MINT corresponds to STEM in Germany). Our school, Istanbul Lisesi, is one of the nearly 300 German gymnasiums worldwide (secondary education in the German education system) that are eligible for the MINT-EC certificate. This qualification allows students from our school to partake in the MINT-Camps, which have a quota of 60 students per camp, from all MINT-EC schools around the world. We are proud to announce that Zeynep Duygulu, our Sergeant-at-Arms, is among the two chosen students from our school to participate in the 2018 DNA Analysis camp.
