			<h3>Numune-i Terakki</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">Numune-i Terakki is Istanbul Lisesi’s seasonal published science magazine prepared by the students and alumni. First published in 1887, it was the first student magazine in Ottoman Empire. Meaning “instance of development” originally, Numune-i Terakki is also the very first name of our school. Thanks to the founder of our school, mathematician Mehmet Nadir Bey, the magazine had a very good academic level from the beginning, and at that time articles and problems that were interesting for both primary and high school students were published. The publication stopped in 1888, but in 2009 students took steps to publish the magazine again. In June 2010, they managed to bring Numune-i Terakki to its publication life again, with its tenth issue.

<h3>International Chess Festival</h3>
	
<p style="text-align:left;">
Being the first international chess festival for high school level in Turkey, the International Chess Festival is held every year since 2001. Nearly 60 schools from both Turkey and other countries take part in this festival which is arranged by the chess club of the school.</p>
	
<h3>TUBITAK Clubs</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">Students interested in science have the chance to participate in Science Olympics organized by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK). This way, TUBITAK can identify scientifically gifted children and to encourage them to develop their talents. The National Science Olympics has been organized since 1993 in 3 subjects: maths,biology and computer science. </p>
