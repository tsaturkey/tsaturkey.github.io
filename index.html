   <h3>Education</h3>
<h4 >Efficiency</h4>
  <p  style="text-align:left;">

It is considerably time-consuming to correct tests, assignments and papers by hand, which our robot can easily help speed-up. Our robot’s software is specifically engineered for efficiency in grading exams as well as scheduling. This way, educators can use their time to prepare for class, interact more with their students and work on their professional development.
Our robot can easily correct the all kinds of multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions. The essay-grading function is still in development and will be released in future updates.

<h4>Adaptive Learning</h4>
<p style="text-align:left;">

The AI is specifically engineered to respond the needs of every student by observing the class and detecting distracted students or those who are struggling with the content, putting greater emphasis on certain topics to ensure that every student is able to follow the lesson.
Additionally, the AI focuses on helping students individually, repeating things that students haven’t understood. Furthermore, the AI allows students to work at their own pace, which helps students with different levels and learning styles to study together in the same classroom.

</p>


<h4 >Outside the classroom Support</h4>
<p style="text-align:left;">

Educators, who have limited time and availability, can’t always help their students. The cost of tutoring and additional educational support can’t be afforded by all families. Our robot helps overcome these difficulties by providing free after-class tutoring.

<h4>Deciding on Career</h4>
<p style="text-align:left;">

The current education system demands students to decide on their career paths early on, which can be challenging at such a young age. Fortunately the AI can help the students by acting as a guide, based on analytical data on their strengths, weaknesses, and interests on each subject.

AI does not only explore their possible future plans, but also assists them by putting more emphasis on specific subjects.
